          This game was created for a University assignment.
          We were required to create a game that was 3D, in third person, contained a 3D modelled building and had a cutscene which featured the building.
          The game I decided to make was a stealth game about fleeing from an office, avoiding surveillance cameras and security guards.
          The office was the building that I 3D modelled and consisted of multiple floors, 2 of which were the setting of the game.
          To pass each floor, the player would have to reach a button to turn off the security lasers before moving down to the next floor until they can eventually leave the office.
          Upon leaving the office, a small cutscene plays and the game comes to an end.
        </p>
        <p class="article">
          This project introduced me to the sound and animation parts of Unity.
          Using these, I was able to add sound effects and ambience to implement audio into the game.
          Using the animation side of Unity, I was able to animate the character for the cutscene.
          I was also able to add an animation tree to move between the different animations for player movement and for the AI enemy movements.
          Throughout the development of this project, I was also able to learn how to program some basic AI for the security guards.
          I implemented a vision radius for the guards which is used to determine whether the player is detected or not.
          Using a navigation mesh, I can allow the guards to navigate the world without moving through obstacles.
          Until the player is detected, they move from point to point, in a predefined pattern.
          Once the player is detected, the guard chases the player until they are caught and the player loses the game.
          Given more time, I would have liked to expand the AI to respond to the player making significant noise such as running or jumping when close to the guards.
